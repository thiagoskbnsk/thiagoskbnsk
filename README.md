### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago Skibinski from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I have almost 10 years of experience in the development area, I've used several different languages and also worked as a fullstack, but what I really like is the front end.
Currently I'm Senior Front End Developer at [JetBridge](https://jetbridge.com/). I'm passionate about javascript, more specifically with node and react.


Would you like to know more about me?
