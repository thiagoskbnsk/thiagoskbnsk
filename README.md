### Hi there 👋

My name is Thiago Skibinski from Brazil (🇧🇷). I have 6 years of experience in the development area, I've used several different languages and also worked as a fullstack, but what I really like is the front end.
Currently I'm Senior Front End Developer at [Vivo](https://www.vivo.com.br). I'm passionate about javascript, more specifically with node and react.

In my free time I like to:
- play video games 🕹️
- watch movies and series 🎞️
- listen and play music 🎵
- get a fresh air 🍃

Would you like to know more about me?
